+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A risk and position-size calculator for spot and futures trades.
+User goal: Avoid blowing up the account because of oversized positions.
+Core features (MVP):
+
+* Input: balance, risk percentage per trade, entry price, stop-loss.
+* Output: recommended position size, leverage, potential loss/profit.
+* Saving several “risk profiles” (conservative, standard, aggressive).
+
+Development plan:
+
+1. Define formulas for risk and position-size calculations.
+2. Create a simple UI with input/output forms.
+3. Add the ability to save settings locally (localStorage).
+4. Optional: converters for different exchanges (lot size / quantity / minimum tick).
+5. Publish as a PWA (so it can be used like a mobile app from the web).
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
